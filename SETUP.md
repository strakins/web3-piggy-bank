# üöÄ Setup Guide for Hedera PiggyBank

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Development server is running at http://localhost:3000**
‚úÖ **All dependencies installed and configured**
‚úÖ **Modern wallet integration implemented**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Requires WalletConnect Project ID and smart contract deployment**

## Next Steps

### 1. Get WalletConnect Project ID (Required)
1. Visit https://cloud.walletconnect.com
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new project
4. Copy your Project ID
5. Add it to your `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
   ```

### 2. Deploy Smart Contract
The `PiggyBank.sol` contract needs to be compiled and deployed:

#### Option A: Using Remix IDE (Recommended)
1. Go to https://remix.ethereum.org
2. Create a new file and paste the content from `src/contracts/PiggyBank.sol`
3. Compile the contract (Solidity 0.8.19+)
4. Deploy to Hedera Testnet using HashPack wallet
5. Copy the contract address and update your `.env`:
   ```
   VITE_CONTRACT_ID=0.0.123456
   ```

#### Option B: Using Hardhat (Advanced)
```bash
# Install Hardhat
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle

# Initialize Hardhat project
npx hardhat init

# Copy PiggyBank.sol to contracts/ folder
# Configure hardhat.config.js for Hedera
# Deploy using: npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network testnet
```

### 3. Test the Application
1. Ensure your `.env` file has the correct values
2. Restart the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Visit http://localhost:3000
4. Connect your HashPack wallet
5. Test depositing, staking, and withdrawing HBAR

### 4. Environment Configuration
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required environment variables:
- `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`: From WalletConnect Cloud
- `VITE_CONTRACT_ID`: Contract address after deployment
- `VITE_OPERATOR_ID`: Your Hedera account ID (for transactions)
- `VITE_OPERATOR_KEY`: Your private key (keep secure!)
