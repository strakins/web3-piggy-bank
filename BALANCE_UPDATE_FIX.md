# ðŸ”„ Balance Update Fix - Deposit Working But Balance Not Updating

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Account Query Address Format** âœ…
   - **Problem**: Was passing raw Hedera account ID to contract query
   - **Solution**: Convert to Solidity address using `AccountId.toSolidityAddress()`
   - **Code**: 
   ```typescript
   const parsedAccountId = AccountId.fromString(accountId);
   const solidityAddress = parsedAccountId.toSolidityAddress();
   // Pass solidityAddress to contract, not raw accountId
   ```

### 2. **Insufficient Refresh Timing** âœ…
   - **Problem**: Only refreshing after 5 seconds (transactions may need more time)
   - **Solution**: Refresh multiple times:
     - Immediately after transaction
     - After 3 seconds
     - After 8 seconds
   - **Code**:
   ```typescript
   await refreshAccountData()  // Immediate
   setTimeout(() => refreshAccountData(), 3000)  // 3 sec
   setTimeout(() => refreshAccountData(), 8000)  // 8 sec
   ```

### 3. **Added Debug Logging** âœ…
   - Detailed console logs for debugging:
     - Account ID conversion
     - Contract query execution
     - Returned values
     - Existence status

## Updated Files

### `/src/services/ModernHederaService.ts`
- âœ… Added Solidity address conversion in `getAccount()`
- âœ… Added comprehensive console logging
- âœ… Better error messages

### `/src/App.tsx`
- âœ… Improved refresh timing for all transactions
- âœ… Triple refresh approach (immediate, 3s, 8s)

## Testing the Fix

1. **Open DevTools**: F12 or Cmd+Option+I
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Make a deposit**
4. **Watch for console logs**:
   ```
   Querying account: { accountId: '0.0.xxx', solidityAddress: '0x...', ... }
   Query result received: ...
   Parsed values: { balance: ..., stakedBalance: ..., exists: true }
   Returning account data: { ... }
   ```

5. **Check UI**:
   - After transaction, balance should appear within 8 seconds
   - If still not showing, check console for errors

## Debugging Checklist

- [ ] Deposit transaction shows "submitted" message
- [ ] Console shows "Querying account" with correct solidity address
- [ ] Console shows "Query result received"
- [ ] Console shows "Parsed values" with exists: true
- [ ] Balance appears in UI
- [ ] Try refreshing page (F5)
- [ ] Try depositing again

## If Balance Still Doesn't Update

### Check 1: Is the Contract Query Failing?
Look for error in console like:
```
Error getting account: [error details]
```
**Solution**: Verify VITE_CONTRACT_ID is correct

### Check 2: Is Account Not Existing on Contract?
Console shows:
```
Account does not exist on contract
```
**Solution**: This means the deposit didn't actually go through the contract. The transaction may have failed silently.

### Check 3: Are Values Zero?
Console shows:
```
Parsed values: { balance: 0, stakedBalance: 0, exists: true }
```
**Solution**: 
- Deposit didn't execute
- Or contract has different function signature
- Check contract's `getAccount` return values

## Contract Integration Notes

The `getAccount` function in PiggyBank.sol returns:
1. `uint256 balance` - Available balance (tinybars)
2. `uint256 stakedBalance` - Staked amount (tinybars)
3. `uint256 withdrawalDate` - Next withdrawal date (timestamp)
4. `uint256 lastDepositDate` - Last deposit time (timestamp)
5. `uint256 totalDeposits` - Total ever deposited (tinybars)
6. `uint256 totalWithdrawals` - Total ever withdrawn (tinybars)
7. `uint256 penaltiesPaid` - Total penalties paid (tinybars)
8. `bool exists` - Whether account exists on contract

## Solidity Address Conversion

When calling contract functions, Hedera account IDs need to be converted:
```
Hedera ID: 0.0.123456
Solidity:  0x000000000000000000000000000000000001e240
```

The SDK does this with: `AccountId.fromString(id).toSolidityAddress()`

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. User connects wallet
2. Dashboard shows "Loading..." then balance (could be 0 if new account)
3. User makes deposit
4. Toast shows "Deposit transaction submitted!"
5. UI shows loading state
6. After 1-3 seconds, balance updates
7. If not, after 8 seconds it definitely updates

## Console Output Example

```
Querying account: { 
  accountId: '0.0.1234567', 
  solidityAddress: '0x00000000000000000000000000000000001336c0',
  contractId: '0.0.4704148' 
}
Query result received: [object Object]
Parsed values: { 
  balance: '5000000000', 
  stakedBalance: '0', 
  exists: true 
}
Returning account data: {
  accountId: '0.0.1234567',
  balance: 5000000000,
  stakedBalance: 0,
  ...
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000
3. Connect wallet
4. Make test deposit
5. Check console for debug output
6. Report any errors with full console logs
