# 🔍 Balance Not Updating - Root Cause & Solution

## The REAL Problem

The contract's `getAccount()` function returns an **entire `Account` struct**, not individual values:

```solidity
struct Account {
    uint256 balance;
    uint256 stakedBalance;
    uint256 withdrawalDate;
    uint256 lastDepositDate;
    uint256 totalDeposits;
    uint256 totalWithdrawals;
    uint256 penaltiesPaid;
    bool exists;
}

function getAccount(address accountAddress) external view returns (Account memory) {
    return accounts[accountAddress];
}
```

The Hedera SDK properly handles this and returns the struct fields in order, so our parsing was actually correct. However, the real issue is likely one of these:

## Possible Root Causes (Check These)

### 1. **Contract Doesn't Have Your Account Data**
   - When you deposit, does the transaction actually execute?
   - Check console logs for: "Account does not exist on contract"
   - **Fix**: Ensure deposit transaction completes successfully
   - **Check**: Look for toast message "Deposit transaction submitted!"

### 2. **Account Query Returns Zero Balance**
   - Contract has account but balance is 0
   - **Reason**: Deposit transaction failed or didn't execute through contract
   - **Check Console**: Look for parsed values like `balance: '0'`

### 3. **Contract ID is Wrong**
   - `.env` has incorrect contract address
   - Query calls different contract than where you deposited
   - **Fix**: Verify `VITE_CONTRACT_ID=0.0.4704148` is correct
   - **Check**: Did you deploy a NEW contract with different ID?

### 4. **Account Not Being Created on Deposit**
   - Contract's `deposit()` function may not be executing
   - Wallet may not be signing correctly
   - **Check**: Look at contract function - does it set `exists = true`?

## Enhanced Debugging (Read Console Logs)

### Expected Console Output (Success Case)

```
Loading account data for: 0.0.123456
Querying account: { 
  accountId: '0.0.123456', 
  solidityAddress: '0x00000000000000000000000000000000001e240',
  contractId: '0.0.4704148' 
}
Query result received: [object Object]
Parsed struct values: { 
  balance: '5000000000',     // This should NOT be '0'
  stakedBalance: '0',
  withdrawalDate: '0',
  exists: true               // This should be TRUE
}
Successfully parsed account data: {
  accountId: '0.0.123456',
  balance: 5000000000,
  stakedBalance: 0,
  ...
}
Account data loaded: {...}
Updating UI with account data
```

### Error Case Console Output

```
Loading account data for: 0.0.123456
Querying account: {...}
Parsed struct values: { 
  balance: '0',
  exists: false              // Account doesn't exist!
}
Account does not exist on contract - returning null
No account data returned - account may not exist on contract
```

## Step-by-Step Debugging

### Step 1: Check Transaction Success
1. Open Browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Make a deposit
4. Look for: "Deposit transaction submitted!" message
5. **If NO message**: Deposit transaction failed
   - Check wallet for error
   - Check contract address

### Step 2: Check Account Creation
1. After deposit, look in console for:
   ```
   Loading account data for: 0.0.xxxxx
   Querying account: {...}
   ```
2. **If NOT there**: Refresh not being called
   - Might need manual refresh
   - Click "Refresh" button if available

### Step 3: Check Contract Query
1. Look for: `Query result received: [object Object]`
2. **If NOT there**: Contract query failed
   - Network issue
   - Wrong contract ID
   - Contract deployed on different network

### Step 4: Check Struct Parsing
1. Look for: `Parsed struct values: { balance: 'XXX', exists: Y }`
2. **If balance is 0**: Deposit didn't go into contract
3. **If exists is false**: Account never created on contract

## Most Likely Issue

**The deposit transaction is probably completing on Hedera, but NOT executing the contract function.**

This could happen if:
- Wrong contract address
- Transaction not being sent to contract properly
- Wallet not properly signing the contract execution

### Quick Fix to Test

1. Check browser console while making deposit
2. Look for ANY errors
3. Report the exact error message
4. Check if toast says "submitted" or "failed"

## Multi-Refresh Strategy

The code now refreshes 3 times:
```typescript
await refreshAccountData()                // Immediate
setTimeout(() => refreshAccountData(), 3000)   // After 3 sec
setTimeout(() => refreshAccountData(), 8000)   // After 8 sec
```

This gives the blockchain time to:
1. Include transaction in block
2. Finalize transaction
3. Update contract state

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open browser console (F12)
- [ ] Ensure "VITE_CONTRACT_ID" is shown (check network tab or console)
- [ ] Make deposit with 1.0 HBAR
- [ ] See "Deposit transaction submitted!" toast
- [ ] Confirm transaction in wallet
- [ ] Watch console logs appear
- [ ] Look for "Parsed struct values" with balance > 0
- [ ] UI updates with new balance

## If Still Not Working

1. **Check console for exact error messages**
2. **Copy the "Querying account" output** - verify contract ID is correct
3. **Look for "Parsed struct values"** - is balance 0 or does account not exist?
4. **Try refreshing page** - manual refresh of account
5. **Try new deposit** - see if multiple deposits accumulate

## Advanced: Manual Balance Check

If balance still shows 0 but you deposited HBAR:

1. Open browser console
2. Check: Did deposit transaction appear in wallet?
3. Check: Did you confirm it?
4. Check: Is your wallet set to **Testnet**?
5. Check: Is the contract on **Testnet**?

The network mismatch is a common issue!
